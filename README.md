Design and production of a mobile application for the digitization of the energy storage process

## Problematic
The O.C.P group follows the consignment procedure, to ensure the safety of employees, and therefore repairs to equipment are then carried out in complete safety.

To carry out repairs on equipment, we have consignment plans which consist of steps to follow.

Currently, the O.C.P group uses an old solution, we are talking here about processing via office tools, the consignment plans are just Word, Excel files..., and to do the consignment, these plans must be printed. so consignment plans are just papers that we can lose at any time for simple reasons.

## Proposed Solution

Today we have to rely on a digitalization solution. An opportunity both to gain efficiency in this process and to improve the monitoring of the state of health of the system via indicators.

All logging procedures can also be grouped and filtered by site. On the other hand, consignment permits, signed electronically directly by the agent in the field via his smartphone. and then we will have an overall view of the operations in progress (consigned, verified, deconsigned...).
